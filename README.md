# btc_tracker_extensio
a Chrome extension to track BTC metrics

Developed as a demo for an ElleHacks presentation on how to develop Chrome extensions.  
I had never made a Chrome extension before, so I thought it would be a good idea to do so before trying to teach other people how to do it.  
The presentation was based on the Ladies Learning Code Intro to Browser Extensions with JavaScript [workshop](https://github.com/ladieslearningcode/llc-intro-to-browser-extensions).  
This Chrome extension tried to show how to make an HTTP request from the extension.
